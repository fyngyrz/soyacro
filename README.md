# soyacro.py - making better posts on soylentnews.org

We're deluged by acronyms and abbreviations. Even though I'm technically
oriented and have been around social networks for quite some time, I see
acronyms and abbreviations I don't know \(or remember\) constantly. If
it's happening to me, it's happening to others. While I can't fix my own
failure to recognize, I can fix the acronyms I use in my posts so that
others can learn about them easily, without otherwise clogging up the
post text with explanations.

So what this project does is provides built-in definitions of acronyms
written in all-capital letters and/or numeric digits used in posts \(as
long as they're in the acronym file, `acrobase.txt`.\) You can edit the
`acrobase.txt` file and add acronyms, and you should, as you find
yourself using them. You might keep an eye on the one in the project, as
I seem to be adding to it regularly. Better yet, submit your additions
here as a pull request, and we all win.

You can produce output that is comprised more than just all-caps and/or
numbers by using the second field, which is a replacement field. The only
restrictions are that there can be no actual commas in the replacement field
\(you can use &amp;#44; if you need a comma, just not an actual comma character\),
and that there be no non-ASCII characters. So, for instance, this line
in the `acrobase.txt` file...

> `TLDR,TL;DR:,Too Long, Didn't Read`

...sets things up so that when you enter TLDR in your post source, the
output post will contain the string `TL;DR:` instead, which corresponds
with the actual common usage.

There is also a built-in macro processor that lets you build shortcuts
for anything, signatures, etc., so you can make richer posts more easily.

### But what if I _need_ non-ASCII characters in a replacement field?

Then you can use HTML entities. For instance, El ni&#241;o can be spelled
as `El ni&#241;o`. Simple as that. You can write the same thing in the
expansion field:

> `ENSO,,El Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation`

### Contributions:

I would particularly appreciate any pull requests that enhance the
acronym file. Anything that is reasonable will be merged. Code PRs
will be carefully checked and if suitable, I will happily accept
those as well.

## Requirements / Installation:

This is a CGI web application, so it needs to run on a webserver such as
Apache. Put all the files into a directory where **Python** cgi applications
\(denoted by files that end in `.py`\) are allowed to run, then
simply access the application with:

> `http://yourserver.tld/cgi-path/soyacro.py`

## Setup

You can use the `ifile` and `mfile` variables in the `soyacro.py` code to
change the name of the acronym and style files. If you're running only on
your own LAN, not much to worry about there. But if the web page is on a
server with WAN access, I recommend renaming both so as to prevent
snoooping, etc. I also suggest you rename the main cgi and set the
`cginame` variable to match.

### More on Security:

This application is something specifically intended for use by the person
who has access to the definition files, which will almost certainly be
the owner of the server permissions. I highly recommend that you do _not_
hand out the URL to this web application, as I wrote it for the use of a
benign user.

On a WAN or untrusted LAN? I've provided a means for
security-by-obscurity, in that you can rename any of the data files \(and
you should do so\) to anything you like, preferably something very
unlikely, so as to prevent anyone from stumbling upon the cgi.

In such a case, you should also rename the main processor. To do this,
you need to change the `cginame` variable at the top of the file to match
the new filename.

Personally, I run this on a webserver inside my LAN, which has no
external means of access and to which no one else has any access, so I'm
not worried about anyone else using it. The above remarks are more meant
for those who only have a public webserver to place this on, or who
have untrusted users on their LAN \(why?\)

## Use:

When you write your post on this page, if you use a known acronym
\(defined as a caps-and/or-numbers sequence in the acronym file\),
it'll be wrapped with HTML `<abbr>` tags and will include an expansion
visible when one hovers a mouse pointer in a web browser.

The result is generated into the lower text box when you press `submit`.

Copy the result and paste it into the soylentnews.org comment box \(or
any other commenting system that allows the `<abbr>` tag.\)

## `acrobase.txt`:

The format is defined at the top of the file. Basically there are three
comma-separated fields. **Important:** _Don't use HTML in these fields._

The first field is the caps-and/or-number sequence that is the acronym,
such as `TIL`, `3D`, or `MHZ`.

The second field is a replacement field that is only used if the all-caps
sequence isn't exactly how the term should be presented. So for `MHZ`,
this field contains `MHz`, which is the correct way to write the term.
For acronymns that are all-caps, this field remains empty.

The third field is the content that is presented when the mouse is
hovered over the acronym in the post.

This file must contain only ASCII characters; no unicode. You can use
HTML entities in the replacement and expansion fields instead, though, so
there's no limit on the accuracy of the results, only on the all-caps
sequences used to trigger them, and those don't show up in the posts
unless there is no replacement field.

### Examples:

> `3D,,Three Dimensional`  
> `411,,A number, and a shorthand for: Information`  
> `MHZ,MHz,Megahertz - Millions of cycles per second`  
> `NASA,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (US)`  

## `aambase.txt`:

This contains macros you can use in your posts. The macro language,
[aa_macro](http://ourtimelines.com/aamacrodoc/general.html) is very
capable, and if you'd like to go further,

[the documentation](http://ourtimelines.com/aamacrodoc/general.html)
awaits. You can use HTML in the macros, but you must use only ASCII; no
unicode. The macro system, in the context of this application, will
process unicode symbols, but the macros themselves cannot be written in
unicode. If you desperately need a unicode character in a macro used
here, then write it as an HTML numeric entity, such as `&#128169;`
(that's the "poop" emoji.) Here's an example of that...

> `[style poophead [b] is a &#128169;-head.]`

...which you would use this way: {poophead fyngyrz}

As to HTML in general, here's a macro that produces a link to my iToolBox
project as a simple example:

_Macro:_

> `[style itoolbox <a target="_blank" href="http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html">iToolBox</a>]`

_Usage:_

> `{itoolbox}`

_Result:_

> `<a target="_blank" href="http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html">iToolBox</a>`

### Examples:

> `[style b <b>[b]</b>]`  
> `[style i <i>[b]</i>]`  
> `[style strike <strike>[b]</strike>]`  
> `[style bq <blockquote>[b]</blockquote>]`  

### Using the Macros:

> `Italizing for emphasis, I {i really} mean it!`

_Produces:_

> `Italizing for emphasis, I <i>really</i> mean it!`

### Squiggly braces are special, because of macro processing

If macro processing is on, you need to be mindful about using `{` and `}`
as these are used to invoke macros. If you want to use them as characters
in a post, just use `{ls}` for the left squiggly brace, and `{rs}` for the
right squiggly brace. **If there are unbalanced squiggly braces in the text,
macro processing is cancelled.**

### Angle braces are special too, because of HTML

Angle braces need to be balanced because of how HTML tags are processed
\(not just by the app, but also by the HTML browser.\) If you need to use
an angle brace in text, use the usual HTML escapes, which are
`&lt;` for the less-than brace, and `&gt;` for the greater-than brace.

If angle braces are unbalanced, the app will warn you.

## The Python files

`soyacro.py` is the cgi you access on your webserver. You might put it in
a cgi-bin folder, along with the other two **Python** files, and then get to
it with `http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/soyacro.py`

Please do observe the ruminations at the top of this readme about security.

## Limitations and Design Choices

This is a **Python** project. It incorporates another **Python** project,
[aa_macro](http://ourtimelines.com/aamacrodoc/general.html), and until
or unless I move that project to **Python3** \(not very likely, but someone
else might undertake that\), **Python** will remain the target here.

Having said all that, by all means feel free to fork and go your own way
with either / both projects. The Github repo for the macro processor is
[here](https://github.com/fyngyrz/aa_macro).

## License

You can use this any way you want. It's 100% free and unencumbered by any
rights claims whatsoever, released into the public domain. It is original
code written by me, and any claims otherwise should be heartily laughed
at and otherwise ignored. Stop feeding the lawyers. Also, if your country
doesn't allow for public domain release by authors, you should get to
work fixing that right away. It's your country, you broke it, you get to
fix it.

The top of the **Python** files present information about development and so
forth if you'd like to peruse that. Otherwise, don't worry about it, and
have fun.
